excerpt: 'Identification of vessel structures of different sizes in biomedical images is crucial in the diagnosis of many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the sparsity of good-quality annotations of such images makes the task of vessel segmentation challenging. Deep learning offers an efficient way to segment vessels of different sizes by learning their high-level feature representations and the spatial continuity of such features across dimensions. Semi-supervised patch-based approaches have been effective in identifying small vessels of one to two voxels in diameter. This study focuses on improving the segmentation quality by considering the spatial correlation of the features using the Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) as an additional loss criterion. Two methods are proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the single (z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume. The proposed MIP-based methods produce segmentations with improved vessel continuity, which is evident in visual examinations of ROIs. In this study, a UNet MSS with ReLU activation replaced by LeakyReLU is trained on the Study Forrest dataset. Patch-based  training is improved by introducing an additional loss term, MIP loss, to penalise the predicted discontinuity of vessels. A training set of 14 volumes is selected from the StudyForrest dataset comprising of 18 7-Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) images. Then it is used to perform a five-fold cross-validation. The generalisation performance of the method  is evaluated using the other unseen volumes in the dataset. It is observed that the proposed method with multi-axes MIP loss produces better quality segmentations with a median Dice of 80.245 ± 0.129. Also, the method with single-axis MIP loss produces segmentations with a median Dice of 79.749 ± 0.109. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the ROIs in the predicted segmentation reveals a ignificant improvement in the continuity of the vessels when MIP loss is incorporated into training.'
