# EL-AURIAN
**Enhanced Learning Algorithms for Ultra-High-Resolution Neurovascular Imaging and Analysis**

EL-AURIAN is a vessel segmentation project led by [Dr Soumick Chatterjee](https://www.soumick.com), in collaboration with [Dr Hendrik Mattern](https://www.bmmr.ovgu.de/mm/en/Team/Hendrik+Mattern.html), [Prof. Andreas NÃ¼rnberger](https://www.findke.ovgu.de/en/nuernberger.html), and [Prof. Oliver Speck](https://www.bmmr.ovgu.de/en/Team/Oliver+Speck.html), which began with the [DS6 study](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/8/10/259), seeks to improve vessel segmentation in ultra-high-resolution 7T ToF-MRAs through the application of deep learning methods.  Thus far, techniques employing four distinct learning paradigms: supervised, semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and unsupervised have been developed as part of this project. Furthermore, the project has created a benchmark dataset, [SMILE-UHURA](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn47164761/wiki/620033), to facilitate progress in this domain and support further advancements.
